## Problem_statement - Identifying the HCP specialization

The objective of the problem is to build a robust model that can accurately predict whether a user belongs to the HCP category and determine their specialization taxonomy. In other words, given a user's behavior data and other features from the ad server logs, the model should be able to classify the user as an HCP or non-HCP (IS_HCP) and identify their specific specialization (TAXONOMY).

## Solution_approach 

To solve this problem, various steps need to be performed, including data cleaning, exploratory data analysis, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. The model will be trained on historical data containing information about HCPs and their specialization, and then it will be used to predict the HCP status and taxonomy for new user data.

we proposed solution for the given problem statement involves using the Random Forest algorithm to solve the problem. Random Forest is a versatile and effective machine learning algorithm that is well-suited for classification tasks, making it an appropriate choice for predicting healthcare specialization.

we got 98% accuracy for this HCP_Predictions and 91% accuracy for the Taxonomy_Predictions
